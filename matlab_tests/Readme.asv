Sparse Representation for Phase Contrast Image
                           

ABOUT
The source code implements preconditioning for phase contrast microscopy image, which provides two different algorithms for use to choose:
1) preconditioning based on a linear imaging model: The source code implements a restoration method for phase contrast image by understanding its optics. We derive a linear imaging model corresponding to the phase contrast optics and formulate a quadratic optimization function to restore the authentic phase contrast image without halos or shade-off artifacts. With artifacts removed, high quality segmentation can be achieved by simply thresholding the restored images.  
2) a modified method based on dictionary representation: we construct a dictionary based on diffraction patterns of phase contrast microscopes. By formulating and solving a min-l1 optimization problem, each pixel is restored into a feature vector corresponding to the dictionary representation. Cells in the images are then segmented by the feature vector clustering. 

It is written in MATLAB for ease of use, and detailed documentation throughout. It supports
Windows and Linux.
